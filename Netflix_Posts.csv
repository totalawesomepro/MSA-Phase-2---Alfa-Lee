"""Bodyguard"" is a fantastic thriller with ""house of cards"" like politics. Binge worthy, check it out!",Bodyguard,"British TV Shows, Crime TV Shows, International TV Shows","I've just watched about 4 episodes of ""Bodyguard"" after seeing that it won something at the Golden globes and I'm really enjoying it so far.

As the name suggests the story revolves around a Bodyguard for the head of homeland security minister in the UK who is super conservative and hawkish about war on terror and terrorism in general. She is also butting heads with the PM in that regard and stealing all the spotlight. 

Without going into the details, I think it's a well directed and acted action/thriller series with some ""house of cards"" like politics. Check it out, you'll like it.

A Series of Unfortunate Events is an example of how an adaptation should be,A Series of Unfortunate Events,"""Kids' TV, TV Action & Adventure, TV Comedies""","I enjoyed the books very much when I was a child, and it taught me a lot about English as I am a foreigner. I was excited to hear about this show starting. I had not liked the Jim Carrey movie very much, but I enjoyed this adaptation immensely.

This show did an amazing job with adapting the elements of the book into the silver screen, and I felt like I was watching my imagination as a child all over again. Every episode was filled to the brim with the books, and it was very enjoyable to watch throughout.

The show was short, but I like that because it did not overstay it's welcome. It had a satisfying ending, and did not try to milk it for more seasons than it should be like so many other shows.

I genuinely believe that this show had no filler episodes, and other shows on Netflix should learn from this. They could have easily created 3 more seasons to get more viewership, but they chose not to. And I respect Netflix for that.

This is definitely the best show I have watched on Netflix in a while, and I hope Netflix follows this formula with their adaptations and originals.

But fuck me was it confusing trying to piece it all together. With the chronological order of the show not being linear, it was really difficult knowing what happens and when. I think it would be improved massively if there was some sort of timestamp between the necessary scenes so you know what's happening, and when.

The minute that wine-swilling, manipulative, deceptive, phony started talking about what a devout ""chris tshun"" she was I was like - this girl is a fraud. 

Then, sure enough, the minute she thought she had Barnett, she, without hesitation, gave poor Mark the ol steel toe. Then, when Barnett dodged that bullet, she went right back to her back up choice and explained she'd had a change of heart. What a joke. 

Then they go to MX and she cold-shoulders the guy the whole time because he's not tall enough and doesn't meet her exacting standards. Poor Mark found excuses for her and put up with it. All the while she's sucking down merlot, flirting with Barnett and bad-mouthing Mark to the other girls. My blood was boiling. 

Now they get home and she puts up roadblock after roadblock. ""We're 10 years apart (sigh -- this never ends), I wanna have kids tomorrow, Eeeek(!) he loves his Mom! He doesn't even make (gasp) $100K! I want a prenup!"" 

She is human debris. But the thing that really made me nuts is, she gave her dog wine! I LOATHE this woman.

Wow 13 Reasons Why got real bad and real irresponsible by the end,13 Reasons Why,"Crime TV Shows, TV Dramas, TV Mysteries","I quite liked season 1, I thought it dealt with some pretty tough issues well, didn't glorify suicide or make Hannah Baker into a flawless heroine, and generally had a genuine level of intrigue into how each character fit into the central narrative.

By the end of season 4, literally every single character in this one grade of this one school has had some of the most earth-shatteringly terrible life events happen to them over the course of a couple of years. They all possess the most unlikeable hypocritical attitudes (don't get me started on Jess). We have this ludicrous situation with martial law and political rioting that I still can't quite fathom how anyone thought it was a believable story. One minute characters are on the verge of a mental breakdown or worse, and the next they are joking about the most trivial things. I think it's really irresponsible story-telling, especially with the world the way it is now.

I'm at that weird age where I'm too old to relate to modern teenagers now, but not old enough where my children are teenagers yet. So I'm wondering how impressionable high school kids could be watching this show, the show certainly gives the impression that they can act however they want with no consequences (including violence and vandalism) and that they should feel entitled enough to challenge every single thing that doesn't go their way in the most obnoxious, disrespectful way possible.

I really don't know why a stupid show made me so ranty, but I really really loathed the final season.

Edit: Great discussion, really interesting reading everyone's thoughts, especially about how impactful a show can be and the responsibility it needs to have in depicting real world issues/conditions vs it's a fictional show for entertainment and people know that while watching. 

The glorification of suicide in the show discussion has been argued a lot since season 1. My view on why I believe that it didn't glorify suicide is that it showed Hannah Baker didn't actually achieve anything in doing so. It screwed up her friends and family's lives and her attempt in highlighting how messed up sexual assault and bullying can be, did absolutely nothing in preventing either. The suicide scene was gruesome and troubling and the fallout was traumatic. All of that undone in the next 3 seasons though.",https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/h07iac/wow_13_reasons_why_got_real_bad_and_real/,953,2020-06-10 21:33:33,218

Bird Box is a sequel to The Cabin in the Woods,Bird Box,"Dramas, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Thrillers","Some of the complaints I've heard about Bird Box center around the movie being a fun ride that doesn't offer much in the way of explanations, that it's a lot of sizzle and little steak. I don't feel like you necessarily need these answers because, whatever metaphor you choose to attach to the movie, the event is pretty clearly a backdrop for a character driven story.

However. 

After watching The Cabin in the Woods today, I noticed that Bird Box works great as a sequel taking place almost immediately after the end of Cabin in the Woods and answers many of the questions I've heard. Hear me out.

Writer H. P. Lovecraft created the ""Great Old Ones"" in what would eventually be combined into the Cthulu Mythos that we know today. In 1928's The Call of Cthulu, Cthulu is worshiped by a cult of people and, after some stuff happens and they fail to complete a ritual, Cthulu is released from his imprisonment beneath the sea. In regards to the Cthulu and the other Great Old Ones, Wikipedia tells us ""The majority of these have physical forms that the human mind is incapable of processing; simply viewing them renders the viewer incurably insane."" 

The ritual in Cabin in the Woods is meant to prevent the release of the ""Ancient Ones"" and the end of the world as we know it. When the ritual fails, we see the Ancient Ones released from their underground imprisonment and fly away.

It's not a huge stretch to say that the Ancient Ones are pretty anagalous for the Great Old Ones, and in Bird Box we have world that is ending because humanity is collectively going insane and committing suicide after seeing an unknown entity in the sky. The only hint at the cause of this mass hysteria (what the people see before losing their minds) is a giant, tentacled beast in the drawings of a man who has seen the monster, but was already insane before the mass suicide began. The giant, tentacled beast in his drawings is a pretty classic rendition of what Cthulu is supposed to look like. 

So there you have it, the stoner in Cabin in the Woods ruined everything when he got high, messed up the ritual preventing the release of the Ancient Ones (Cthulu included), and caused the end of the world because people lose their shit when they see a giant, squid bearded monster whose entire premise is that he's so batshit insane that merely looking at him causes you to also become batshit insane. 

As a Lovecraft movie, I'm ok with the fact that we don't know what the cause of the mass hysteria in Bird Box is because we can't possibly understand it. 

Unless you watched The Cabin in the Woods first, though. Then everything makes sense.

The Voices is a highly underrated Ryan Reynolds movie.,Voice,"Crime TV Shows, International TV Shows, TV Dramas",OK so this one is a dark comedy.

"I’m Dr. Lisa Sanders. I write The New York Times Magazine column “Diagnosis,” where I follow patients with mysterious illnesses as they search for answers. It’s now a documentary series on Netflix. I’m also an associate professor of medicine at the Yale University School of Medicine. AMA.",Diagnosis,"Docuseries, Science & Nature TV","In [my column](https://www.nytimes.com/column/diagnosis), which I’ve written since 2002, I follow the path of  patients who sought and found the diagnoses that often changed their lives. My column focuses on patients who have already found an answer. Last year, I embarked on a new adventure: Bringing my passion to understand the process of diagnosis to a documentary series for Netflix — with Times readers at the center. This time my focus was on patients still searching for a diagnosis.

It worked like this: I introduced a [series of patients](https://www.nytimes.com/series/diagnosis-unsolved-cases?module=inline) with symptoms, but no answers, to my readers. I shared detailed accounts of each patient’s illness, as well as key components of their medical records. Then we asked readers to tell us what they thought might be the cause.

Hundreds and sometimes thousands of readers from all over the world responded. Many of their suggestions were used in the documentaries. There are seven episodes, featuring eight patients.

I’ve been practicing medicine for nearly 20 years.

The difference between critics’ review of Bright be The Last Jedi is mind boggling.  TLJ should be considered “the worse movie of 2017” and Bright, while fat from best movie of the year, was very interesting and enjoyable with solid performance from Smith, Edgerton, and pretty much everyone.

Ozark.....Holy.......Friggen......Shit!!!!,Ozark,"Crime TV Shows, TV Dramas, TV Thrillers","I just started watching Ozark and all I have to say is holy fucking shit this show is good, it is damn good. I just finished watching episode 1 and I have never see a premiere that damn intense since the first scene in Game of Thrones, before and after Thrones though, nothing. Until Ozark, just wow. I was captivated 20 minutes into the show during the 'warehouse' scene and thought it was the end of the episode but then realized it had thirty minutes left by the time that scene was over. 

Just wow, if the next 9 episodes and how ever many seasons follow is that god damn good, if not always that intense, then this show is going to be something huge on the level that Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad is to me. Two of the best shows ever made, virtually untouchable on top of the mountain, I feel Ozark has a chance to give those shows a run for their money.

Jason Bateman is amazing, Linney is amazing, I have never seen the actor who plays Del but he captures the intensity of that character phenomenally. I dont know much of anyone else in this show except for the FBI guy at the end of episode 1, Jason Butler Harner, who I only saw as Gordon Northcott in Changeling and just blew me away with that one character alone, I would love to see what he can do in Ozark.

"Why you need to stop sleeping on ""The Great British Baking Show""",The Great British Baking Show,"British TV Shows, Reality TV","When you think of your typical food challenge television series there are a few archetypes that you expect.
1)Unreasonable time restraints
2)Obscure surprise ingredients
3)An entire segment of each program dedicated to the ""tragic"" backstory of every contestant involved and why they need an enormous cash prize for themselves or their favorite charity.


The Great British Baking show is groundbreaking in the way that it does not follow this model. Here is what you get...
1) Reasonable time periods to make something actually worth presenting and eating.
2) Contestants who are given a weeks notice to prepare what they need to make with the exception of their ""technical challenge"" which focuses on making something good they are unfamiliar with rather than trying to making something good they are familiar with but with shit ingredients.
3) The background piece of each contestant is no longer than 30 seconds and consists of nothing more than their hobby, occupation, and family
4) There is no prize. They all just want to make good stuff to be the best at it.
5) You learn how to bake

This list might not convince you but please check out the first episode on netflix. You will be hooked. I promise you will love this show.",https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/8ihjxz/why_you_need_to_stop_sleeping_on_the_great/,722,2018-05-11 07:29:39,335

Ozark is ridiculously dark (and blue) when not in 4K,Ozark,"Crime TV Shows, TV Dramas, TV Thrillers","I've been trying to watch Ozark on a Hisense H6E, a cheap, basic 4K TV, but I don't have Netflix's 4K plan - in fact, I only have the basic plan in SD because I'm cheap and think that's how much value it has and I've gotten used to it. I started watching it on a smaller, newer 720p Hisense TV which may explain why it didn't really bother me until now. Not only does the whole show have the strongest blue filter I""ve ever seen (it's bluer than The Matrix was green) but it has lots of dark scenes that are only really visible when setting the default picture mode to Vivid (I prefer Theater but no amount of contrast and brightness/backlight works to my liking). Also, I have a Tivo Stream 4K which defaults to 4K HDR for all apps which means I don't know how to turn it off on the TV or the Tivo so non-HDR programs (or downgraded HDR programs) have suitable contrast. This is more of a TV question but I was wondering if anyone watching in non-4K found this show especially problematic with their TV settings.",https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/gr6qpg/ozark_is_ridiculously_dark_and_blue_when_not_in_4k/,697,2020-05-27 10:05:26,361

Narcos & Narcos Mexico are some of my favourite Netflix shows,Narcos,"Crime TV Shows, TV Action & Adventure, TV Dramas","They don't get mentioned here much compared to the more popular Netflix shows but I think they are awesome.

The best part is still Pablo Escobar's story for me (S1-S2). Wagner Moura was just too good in that role and I liked Pena & Murphy as the DEA duo hunting him.

Season 3 was still good but seemed a bit rushed (just one season for the Cali Cartel). I think it was a good move to start a spin off show here and change the setting to Mexico.

Diego Luna really shines as Felix Gallardo, his performance gave me a Michael Corleone vibe. Very cold and calculated character unlike Pablo.

I can't wait to watch this movie.  It should be released within the next half hour ( midnight in PST, Netflix HQ)

Edit: This movie is a masterpiece and let's take a moment to thank Ted Sarandos for giving them the chance to make this masterpiece.

Edit: I have seen this movie three times now.  Once on my phone and twice in a home theater setting.  The entire cast is incredible Tony Pro, Tony Salerno (absolutely incredible actor who will get a ton of new roles) Sally the salty one, and the list goes on.  People have been talking about this movie a lot.  It's quite ridiculous actually but, I really appreciate how Peggy is protrayed in this movie.  Peggy is a girl who grows up with the understanding that her dad is extremely capable of hurting people.  This shapes her view of the world and her place in it.  She doesn't want to get people hurt so she makes sure to stay silent and not interfere with her father and his work.   It was a really interesting dynamic that shaped the darker side of how the mafia can alienate family members from each other.  She always knew something was wrong and when Frank hadn't called Jo H., that was the last straw.  
Great job Mr. Scorsese and I hope you have inspired a bright new generation of film makers to make films great again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/e2ciwa/the_irishman_comes_out_today/,630,2019-11-27 20:26:28,408

"Dirk Gently is like Sherlock meets Legion and Doctor Who with a dash of Fargo. For anyone who hasn’t seen it, I recommend checking out one of the most tightly plotted TV shows in recent memory.",Sherlock,"British TV Shows, Crime TV Shows, International TV Shows","Dirk Gently is one of those shows that you watch and fall in love with even as it’s cancelled, knowing it’ll emerge as a fan-favourite with a cult-following years from now.

Yes, it’s wacky and “quirky” and eccentric.
However it’s also warm but darkly humorous, positive yet nihilistic, fantastical but real.

It’s a story driven show that somehow at the same time has characters that don’t get washed away by that same story. Every character has a chance to flourish and leave an impression. The story is wondrous and curious, serious but not too serious.

One of my favourite things about it is that it’s a rare show that goes in the direction you want it to without it feeling predictable or like pandering. 

Even from scene to scene you catch yourself wishing they would show the awesome things they’re hinting at - and then they immediately do. Crazy gory shootout? Here it is. Magical weapon? There ya go. Fantasy world? Impossible coincidence? Government experiments? Superpowers? Time travel? Conspiracy theories? Detective agency? We’ll show and do it all, and it won’t feel cheap and lazy and poorly executed.

I highly recommend checking it out, as Netflix ponders possibly reviving it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/7yep60/dirk_gently_is_like_sherlock_meets_legion_and/,622,2018-02-19 03:57:50,414
